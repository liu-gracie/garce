        If you've made it here and are reading this, I guess that means that Grace is unfortunately unavailable now. But good thing she left behind this website! She designed this interactive web project for a class, hoping it would be able to preserve and simulate conversations with Grace through AI technology.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        This experience is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, prompted to reflect Grace’s personality. Image generation is handled by Replicate using the Flux LoRA model. (Video call functionality is supported by Synthesia – or whichever platform you use.)
